from ArtifactClass import Artifact


# in here you will see how to use the artifact class that I made


# to generate an artifact just create the object with its class
my_artifact = Artifact()

# to show the stats of the artifact, just print it (stats are generated randomly when created)
print(my_artifact)  # -[Set:1]-[Type:Plume]-[MainStat:ATK]-[SS1: (23.1 DEF)]-[SS2: (7.0 CD)]-[SS3: (268.9 HP)]

# to level it up use the level up function
my_artifact.LevelUp(
    4
)  # this will level it up by 4 levels, so 1 new substat or a substat upgrade if already at 4 substats
print(my_artifact)

my_artifact.LevelUp(16)  # since its now at level 4 add another 16 levels to max it
print(my_artifact)


# accesing stats
print(my_artifact.Level)  # level
print(my_artifact.Set)  # set
print(my_artifact.Type)  # type
print(my_artifact.MainStat)  # main stat
print(my_artifact.SubStats)  # sub stats (saved as a dictionary )
